# PCManager
Ever popped away from your PC for a few seconds and then found yourself watching a movie or getting some odd jobs done, only to realise you've left your system running half way through?

Because I have. Too many ruddy times.

Here's the solution! A phone app that allows you to perform actions such as shutting down or locking your PC from anywhere in your home with the press of a button, right in your pocket!

The PCManager is a mobile/PC application that enables users to control basic OS functions via LAN.
Features include:
	Shutdown
	Standby
	Lock
	Reboot
	
This repository holds two projects.
- Android
	This is the Android app. It acts as the client and sends requests to the Desktop
	
- Desktop
	This is a JVM based application for Windows. It acts as the server and manages the requests via system calls.
